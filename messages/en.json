      "q20": "Can I use Binelek without the AI features?",
      "a20": "Yes! While AI is a core feature, you can also use traditional dashboards, manual workflows, and visual builders without using natural language queries.",
      "q21": "How accurate are the AI responses?",
      "a21": "Our AI pulls directly from your connected data sources, so answers are based on your real data. We always show the source so you can verify.",
      "q22": "What data does the AI have access to?",
      "a22": "The AI only has access to data you've connected. It cannot access anything outside your authorized integrations."
